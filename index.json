We\u0026rsquo;re Josh Meek \u0026ldquo;the Über Geek\u0026rdquo; and Toby Tobes! We\u0026rsquo;ve been friends for a really long time, and bonded over our mutual love of pro wrestling, Power Rangers, and punk rock.\nWhat We\u0026rsquo;ve Done\u003e What We\u0026rsquo;ve Done # We met on the /r/SquaredCircle Reddit discussion board when Josh auditioned to be on a wrestling podcast that Toby was a part of. After that, we started Overanalyzed, a \u0026lsquo;MST3K\u0026rsquo;-esque watchalong series focusing on Power Rangers. It was popular, but eventually YouTube copyright strikes put an end to that project. Afterwards, we collaborated once again on a pop culture podcast called the Geek Pod.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve also done many solo projects! Toby is a prolific video game YouTuber, having notably played the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series, in addition to countless other games. Josh created the long-running bite-sized pop culture news show \u0026ldquo;Pretty Dece\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat This Show Is\u003e What This Show Is # Now, we\u0026rsquo;ve joined forces once again to watch and discuss Kamen Rider! For the unitiated, Kamen Rider is a decades-long Japanese television franchise starring superheroes known as \u0026ldquo;Kamen Riders\u0026rdquo;. The shows are live-action, featuring actors in elaborate suits and costumes. Kamen Rider is a sister series to Super Sentai, which many western fans will know as the source material for Power Rangers! Kamen Rider seasons are typically aimed at a slightly older audience, with more complicated storylines and more mature themes (while still being kid shows).\nFor Toby, this is his very first experience with Kamen Rider. Josh has watched a handful of seasons in the past. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re working our way through Kamen Rider Geats and reviewing each episode.\n","date":"4 September 2021","permalink":"/about/","section":"The Comment Riders","summary":"Two giant nerds explore the world of Kamen Rider.","title":"About Us"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"}]
