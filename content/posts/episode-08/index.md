Our Kamen Rider heroes know their mission: They must kick the boss monster's energy drink can out of the Jyamato area in order to win and save the world... but even with the stakes that high they still struggle to work together.

This episode also features Keiwa finally shedding all of his trepidation and becoming the true badass that we always knew he could be.
