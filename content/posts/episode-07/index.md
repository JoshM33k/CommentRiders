This episode has ended up being one of our favorites thus far, mostly because of the awesome character development that we get throughout! The scene where Keiwa and his sister meet up with Ace and Neon at the soba shop is top tier, and gives us some insight into each of the four.

We also get a shocking revelation about Ace in this episode... he might be older than Jesus?!? Finally, Ace once again betrays Keiwa's trust to gain the upper hand as this episode closes.
