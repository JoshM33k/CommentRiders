The Comment Riders are Toby and Josh and they are watching and reviewing Kamen Rider Geats!

In this episode, a game ends... but without a winner! Shocking revelations abound in this episode, including the end (for now?) of our Game Master Girori, and the pulling back of the curtain on the true nature of the DGP.

This episode seems like it has far-reaching implications for the future of the series, so we were super excited to dive in and discuss it!
