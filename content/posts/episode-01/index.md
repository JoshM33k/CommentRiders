A new season of Kamen Rider begins, and with it, Toby and Josh join forces once again to discuss the HECK out of it! This season seems to be Battle Royale inspired, as our Kamen Rider heroes will compete in the Desire Grand Prix.

In this first auspicious episode, we find that Toby has never seen a single episode of a Kamen Rider! He's got lots of questions as the guys dive headfirst into a discussion and review of Kamen Rider Geats.
