In this episode a new round of the Desire Grand Prix begins, one in which the Kamen Riders are paired up and must eliminate jyamato that are now sporting playing card attire. What could it mean??

We also get introduced to a new mysterious Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Punkjack. Punkjack is an admin of the Desire Grand Prix who will be participating in order to even up the teams. Will there be more to Punkjack than meets the eye?
