In this episode, the Jyamato exhibit surprising new abilities, as we find out they can transform into nightmare versions of Kamen Riders!

Meanwhile, our heroes take part in a Resident Evil inspired game while trapped in the grounds of an abandoned mansion, locked within a Jyamato alternate dimension. They have to solve a code to escape and defend themselves from the Jyamato, all while protecting a group of civilians, including former Kamen Rider Keiwa!

The production value and creativity in this episode were top notch, and we couldn't wait to discuss it with you!
