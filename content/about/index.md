## Who We Are

Hi! We're Josh Meek "the Ãœber Geek" and Toby Tobes! We've been friends for a really long time, and bonded over our mutual love of pro wrestling, Power Rangers, and punk rock.

## What We've Done

We met on the /r/SquaredCircle Reddit discussion board when Josh auditioned to be on a wrestling podcast that Toby was a part of. After that, we started Overanalyzed, a 'MST3K'-esque watchalong series focusing on Power Rangers. It was popular, but eventually YouTube copyright strikes put an end to that project. Afterwards, we collaborated once again on a pop culture podcast called the Geek Pod.

We've also done many solo projects! Toby is a prolific video game YouTuber, having notably played the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series, in addition to countless other games. Josh created the long-running bite-sized pop culture news show "Pretty Dece".

## What This Show Is

Now, we've joined forces once again to watch and discuss Kamen Rider! For the unitiated, Kamen Rider is a decades-long Japanese television franchise starring superheroes known as "Kamen Riders". The shows are live-action, featuring actors in elaborate suits and costumes. Kamen Rider is a sister series to Super Sentai, which many western fans will know as the source material for Power Rangers! Kamen Rider seasons are typically aimed at a slightly older audience, with  more complicated storylines and more mature themes (while still being kid shows).

For Toby, this is his very first experience with Kamen Rider. Josh has watched a handful of seasons in the past. Now, we're working our way through Kamen Rider Geats and reviewing each episode.
